Here are the guidelines for checking if the PR is following the guidelines:
- The "statusCheckRollup" in the pull request details may help you to identify if the PR is following some of the guidelines (e.g. CLA compliance).
- If a new sample folder is added, check for the existence of a `README.md` within that folder. If missing, add a comment asking the author to add one.
- If `*.py`, `*.js`, or `*.java` files are added/changed, check if `requirements.txt`, `package.json`, or `pom.xml`/`build.gradle` are also modified or present.
