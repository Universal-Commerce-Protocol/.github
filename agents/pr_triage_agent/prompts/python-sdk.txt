- The "statusCheckRollup" in the pull request details may help you to identify if the PR is following some of the guidelines (e.g. CLA compliance).
- If files are modified in the main SDK directory (e.g., `/ucp_sdk/`) but no files in `/tests/` are touched, add a comment asking if tests need to be added or updated.
- If new public classes, methods, or functions are added, check if they contain docstrings. If not, ask the author to add them.
