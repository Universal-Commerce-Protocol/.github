Here are the guidelines for checking if the PR is following the guidelines:
- The "statusCheckRollup" in the pull request details may help you to identify if the PR is following some of the guidelines (e.g. CLA compliance).
- If files in `/src/` are modified but no files in `/tests/` are touched, add a comment asking if tests need to be added or updated.

- If `package.json` is modified, check that `package-lock.json` is also part of the PR. If not, ask the author to include it.
